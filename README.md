# Command Line Data Transfer on CURC Resources (RC Primer)

In this RC Primer* course, we will go through the fundamentals of 
accessing and transferring data on CU Research Computing (CURC) 
resources. Specifically, this course will provide a brief overview 
of the various tools used to access data on CURC resources. We will 
then discuss how to transfer data using the command line via commands 
such as SCP and Rsync.

In order to follow along with the hands-on component of this workshop, 
youâ€™ll want to have a Research Computing account and the ability to 
access a terminal on your local computer. If you need assistance with 
this, please attend CRDDS Office Hours prior to the workshop.

/* What is an RC Primer?: An RC Primer is a session that provide an 
introduction to concepts, systems, and tools. You can expect to leave 
"Primers" with an introductory-level understanding of the topic.
